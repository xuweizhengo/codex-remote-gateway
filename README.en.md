# codex-remote

[中文说明](README.md)

## Product Preview

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Remote and local side by side | Use Feishu, WeChat, and Telegram to control local Codex App, the Codex VS Code extension, and Codex CLI. The same Codex session can stay synchronized between IM and local clients. |
| Non-invasive Codex access | Does not modify Codex frontend code. It writes local config so Codex remote-control can connect to the local backend. |
| Manage Codex sessions from IM | Use the native Codex remote-control protocol to create and resume Codex sessions from IM. |

## Quick Start

### For Codex App and the VS Code extension, you usually only need to download the app, fill the provider key, enable it, scan the IM QR code, then restart Codex App or the VS Code extension. Codex CLI still requires starting its own app-server.

### 0. Prerequisites

- macOS, Windows, or Linux device
- Codex App, the Codex VS Code extension, or Codex CLI
- No ChatGPT account and no acceleration network required
- A third-party key for a GPT-5.x-compatible model
- At least one IM channel: Feishu, Telegram Bot, or WeChat bot

### 1. Install

Download `Codex Remote.dmg` from GitHub Releases, drag it to Applications, then open it. On Windows, run `codex-remote.exe` from the release package. On Linux, download `Codex Remote Linux x86_64.AppImage`, make it executable, then double-click it.

If macOS warns that the app was downloaded from the internet, confirm the system prompt. If your Linux desktop does not mark the AppImage as executable automatically, run `chmod +x "Codex Remote Linux x86_64.AppImage"` once. The app does not install startup items and does not run in the background automatically.

Later, use `Help -> Check for Updates` to manually check GitHub Releases for a newer version. The MVP only opens the download page; it does not silently replace the local app.

### 2. Open The App

Open `Codex Remote`. The GUI starts the local backend automatically and stops the backend it started when the GUI exits.

Continue when the status overview shows the local service is running.

### 3. Connect An IM Channel

Open the `消息接入` page and choose one channel:

- Feishu: click `扫码使用新机器人` and complete QR onboarding.
- Telegram: paste the BotFather token and click `保存并接入`. Telegram currently supports private bot chats only; group chats are ignored.
- WeChat: click `扫码连接微信` and confirm in WeChat.

After a channel is connected, the `IM 通道` status panel becomes available. Normal use does not require scanning or entering the token again unless you switch bots.

### 4. Fill Model Info

Open the `Codex 接入` page, click `新增`, then fill your model service settings:

- Provider name
- Third-party Base URL
- API Key

Provider name can be empty. If it is empty but Base URL or API Key is filled, the default provider name is `ai-codex`.

### 5. Enable Provider

Click `保存` to save the current provider only. Click `启用` to save the current provider and make Codex App use it.

Enabling a provider backs up the old config, points Codex remote control to local `codex-remote`, and writes local auth plus the current model provider.

### 6. Open Codex

Open Codex App or the Codex VS Code extension normally, then enable remote-control / control this computer.

When connected, `Codex Remote` shows the Codex control channel as connected.

You do not need to see a remote device list in Codex App's connection settings. This project uses a local backend plus IM bridge. If the `Codex Remote` status overview is normal, you can use it directly from the connected IM channel.

If Codex App, the Codex VS Code extension, and Codex CLI are connected to `Codex Remote` at the same time, new or resumed IM sessions choose the execution endpoint by fixed priority: Codex App > Codex VS Code extension > Codex CLI. After a session is bound, later messages keep using the selected endpoint until the IM session exits or binds again.

### 7. Use Codex CLI

If you want Codex CLI to work with Feishu / Telegram / WeChat, you do not need to replace the `codex` command or install a wrapper. Use the same three-step flow on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

1. Open the `Codex Remote` desktop app, finish IM channel setup and Codex access, and keep it running.

2. Open a terminal in the project directory and start Codex app-server:

```text
codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:3849 --remote-control
```

3. Open another terminal in the same project directory and connect the local Codex TUI:

```text
codex --remote ws://127.0.0.1:3849
```

After that, you can message the bot from IM, and you can also keep using the same Codex app-server from local Codex TUI. If port `3849` is already in use, choose another local port, but keep the addresses in step 2 and step 3 identical.

### 8. Use IM

Send a message to the bot in Feishu, a Telegram private chat, or WeChat.

If the IM chat is not bound to a Codex thread yet, the bot first asks you to create a new thread or resume an existing one. After selection, the chat is bridged to that Codex thread.

The WeChat path depends on a context token issued by the WeChat client. During long tasks or when the phone client has been inactive for a while, the token may expire and the local backend may temporarily be unable to send messages. If this happens, send `!` or `?` in WeChat to refresh the token. These activation messages are only used to recover the send path and are not forwarded to Codex.

## Community And Support

The WeChat public account is recommended for technical notes, implementation write-ups, and project updates.

The WeChat group is for issue feedback, usage discussion, and feature suggestions.

## IM Commands

Only `/q` is needed in normal use. Follow the card prompts for other actions.

```text
/q         interrupt and clear the current binding
```

Approval prompts are updated after selection where the platform supports it.

## Clear Codex Access

Click `清除 Codex 接入` in the GUI to remove this project's root Codex routing entries:

- `chatgpt_base_url`
- `model_provider`

## Project Boundary

`codex-remote` only supports the clean official Codex remote-control path.

It does not:

- install a `codex` wrapper
- replace Codex CLI
- launch Codex App through a shim
- install login items or startup agents
- run as a background service automatically
- change Codex model, sandbox, approval policy, cwd, or environment

The local backend starts only when the user opens the GUI or explicitly starts it from development tooling.

## Technical Notes

Runtime path:

```text
Codex App / Codex VS Code extension / Codex CLI app-server
  |
  | chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3847/backend-api"
  | user enables remote control, or starts codex app-server --remote-control
  v
official Codex app-server
  |
  | outbound remote-control websocket
  v
codex-remote local backend
  |
  | Feishu websocket events
  | Feishu message/card APIs
  | Telegram long polling
  | Telegram Bot API
  | WeChat iLink long polling
  | WeChat sendmessage API
  v
IM channel
```

The project implements the official remote-control endpoints:

```text
POST /backend-api/wham/remote/control/server/enroll
GET  /backend-api/wham/remote/control/server
```

Codex remote-control requires a ChatGPT-compatible auth mode. This project writes local `ChatgptAuthTokens` to satisfy Codex App's remote-control account check. API-key-only auth does not start remote control.

Thread binding model:

- Codex app-server remains the source of truth for thread lifecycle and history.
- One IM chat binds to one Codex thread at a time.
- If the IM chat has not bound a thread yet, the bridge asks whether to create or resume a thread.
- Resuming a thread from IM subscribes to that thread's future remote-control events.
- IM-origin turns are tracked by turn id to avoid `userMessage` echo.

## Commands

```text
codex-remote [--config PATH] daemon
codex-remote [--config PATH] status
codex-remote [--config PATH] on
codex-remote [--config PATH] off
codex-remote [--config PATH] configure-codex-app [--codex-home PATH] [--provider-name NAME] [--provider-base-url URL] [--provider-key TOKEN] [--model MODEL]
codex-remote [--config PATH] uninstall-codex-app [--codex-home PATH]
```

`on` / `off` enable or pause the IM bridge.

`configure-codex-app` is the CLI equivalent of enabling a provider in the GUI. If model provider config is written, the default provider is `ai-codex` and the default model is `gpt-5.5`.

## Configuration

`config.toml` is for `codex-remote` itself:

```toml
bind = "127.0.0.1:3847"
statePath = "codex-remote-state.json"

[feishu]
appId = ""
appSecret = ""
mentionOnly = true
allowedOpenIds = []
allowedChatIds = []

[telegram]
botToken = ""
allowedChatIds = []

[wechat]
accountId = "wechat"
botToken = ""
baseUrl = ""
userId = ""
botType = "3"
allowedUserIds = []

[bridge]
enabled = true
accountId = "default"
sendStreaming = true
```

Telegram is for the simple private-chat flow: create your own bot with BotFather, then chat with that bot in Telegram. Group chats are intentionally ignored so group members cannot control the host machine through the bot. `allowedChatIds = []` means "bind the first private chat"; the first private chat that messages the bot is written to the allowlist automatically, and later private chats are rejected. You can also prefill `allowedChatIds = ["123456789"]` to lock it to your own Telegram private chat.

WeChat config is normally written by GUI QR onboarding. `botType = "3"` follows the current OpenClaw WeChat bot path. Do not commit real `botToken` values.

Codex client config is separate and usually lives at `~/.codex/config.toml`.

See [config.example.toml](config.example.toml) and [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Development

```powershell
cargo fmt
cargo test
cargo build --release --features gui --bin codex-remote
```

Useful status endpoints while the daemon is running:

```text
GET http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/status
GET http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/remote-control/status
GET http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/remote-control/backend-status
GET http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/events
```

## Security Notes

- The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Do not expose it publicly.
- `config.toml` stores Feishu `appId` / `appSecret`, Telegram `botToken`, and WeChat `botToken`; do not commit it.
- Codex App `auth.json` and third-party provider keys are local secrets; do not commit them.
- Attachments from Feishu are downloaded to a local state-adjacent `.im/attachments/feishu/` directory.
- Restrict access with `allowedOpenIds` and/or `allowedChatIds` for real usage.
- The bridge can send approval decisions to Codex. Treat Feishu / Telegram / WeChat access as equivalent to local Codex approval access.
